Conv layer should be precceded with BatchNorm
Add Dropouts after Dense and ConV Layer Only
Pooling Layer should not be Coninuously stacked 


Last Layer Should be Ideally Flatten and Dense With Softmax -  Multi Label Classification Sigmoid - Binary


Analysis to Do: 

Model Depth Efficiency: No of Layers Depth vs Accuracy 
Trainning Complexity : No of Layes vs Trainning Time (Include Per Iteration Timing)

Model Generalisation Capability : No of Layers vs Train Accuracy and Validation Accuracy

Model Capacity : Accuracy vs Number of Params
