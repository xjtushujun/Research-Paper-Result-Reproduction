### TODO
1. Process the MNIST and SVNH Dataset as required: Crudely Done
  * MNIST : 5-9 Classes - Done
  * SVNH : 0-4 Classes - Done
2. Creation of Architecture as shown in the image : ![architecture](https://github.com/Gokkulnath/Research-Paper-Result-Reproduction/blob/master/Domain%20Adaptaion%20in%20Video/ARchitecture - Copy.PNG) - Keras Issue - Need Debugging
3. Train the Model with Optimiser Specified Separately and load the weights in the main experiment.
4. Initialise Weights only for Source CNN Model with the pretrained weights.
5. Proceed with Trainning the Entire Architecture.
